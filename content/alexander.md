Developed a century ago and now scientifically recognised throughout the world as a powerful method of dealing with physical and mental stress, encouraging personal growth and transformation.   

It is a way of becoming more aware of balance, posture and movement in everyday activities.  

Most of us have learned habits which interfere with our natural poise, coordination and functioning.  

The role of the Alexander Teacher is to re-educate the whole body & mind using gentle guidance with the hands and subtle thought processes. 

This helps unravel our inappropriate responses and encourages the natural reflexes to work again, thereby easing stress-related symptoms such as headaches, backache, neck & shoulder hypertension, all repetitive strain injuries etc. 

Small introductory classes, individually tailored Birth preparation & support and Doula (Birth companion) sessions.
