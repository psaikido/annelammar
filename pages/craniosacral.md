title: Craniosacral Therapy
---

It is an extremely gentle hands-on therapy using no manipulation. At the core of the body the cerebrospinal fluid which bathes and cushions the brain and spinal cord, expresses a motion in a tide-like ebb and flow. This moves the bones of the skull and is reflectded in the organs and all the structures of the body. However, congestions and restrictions in the body's or e.g.vertebraes out of allignment show up in the way that this craniosacral motion is not able to express itself freely. Treatment is comprised of this gentle listening touch, which is both diagnostic and therapeutic. It assists the release of compression and stress in tissues, bone, organs, fluids and the nervous system, towards a higher level of functioning and a revitalisation of the mechanisms as a whole. It is safe and suitable for people of all ages, even in fragile or acutely painful conditions. Accidents,injuries, birth trauma, colic, learning difficulties, exhaustion, migraines, back pain, dental trauma. ME symptoms, plus lots more, all react favourably to this treatment.
